# guitar-tuner
Simple guitar tuner made in python &amp; kivy

The tuning algorithm was made by chciken, so all props to him, you can check his blog post here: https://www.chciken.com/digital/signal/processing/2020/05/13/guitar-tuner.html

The GUI was made with Kivy.

To run just run main.py

I'm currently working on a .apk for mobile usage, will update when i have it ready.
